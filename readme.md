# HC-COMMON package
This is a heating controller for European style water+radiators style heating system.
I deploy it on a Raspberry Pi, but in theory it will work on any hardware/OS with file-mapped devices.

This is a hobby project, you are welcome to use the code but it insn't intended for public use.
There are many off-the-shelf heating controllers available, I'm writing another because: 
1. for my own entertainment
2. because my wife wants a controller that works exactly as she wants it to
3. it is dangerous to igniore item 2 

This package contains common items shared between the other HC packages: hc-server and hc-webclient.
